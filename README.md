This is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3×3 grid. It includes logic to detect win conditions, draws, and player turns, providing a smooth and user-friendly gaming experience. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
